The following clarification is taken verbatim from the file COPYING in the
source distribution:

	Code is copyrighted by Michael Hipp, who made it free software under
	the terms of the LGPL 2.1.

	But that is not all of it.  mpg123 is licensed under the GNU General
	Lesser Public License, version 2.1, and in parts under the GNU General
	Public License, version 2.  That means that _all_ of mpg123 is licensed
	under GPL and the major part also under the LGPL.

	Actually, the "major part" currently is the whole distributed package
	of mpg123. There are some files (old alsa output, libao output) that
	you get from our svn repository and that do not fall under LGPL.

	When the copyright marker in a source file says "the mpg123 project"
	that means that the file contains code copyrighted by contributors to
	mpg123, the "initially written by" naming the person(s) that created
	the file and thus may have the largest part of copyrights on it.  I am
	explaining this here to emphasize that the copyright always actually
	lies by the individual member (i.e. contributor to) of the mpg123
	project who wrote a specific section of code.  Usage of a source code
	management system like Subversion should provide keeping track of
	individual copyright traces...

	Please consider that any code that is contributed to the mpg123 project
	shall be licensed under LGPL 2.1 .  If you want to contribute, but
	don't agree to that (i.e. you want to have your code GPL only) please
	say so - then, we either you convince is to include your code under
	GPL, we convince you to make it LGPL instead or, as a last resort,
	you'll have to do you own GPLed fork.  But we should try to avoid the
	last option...

	All files in the distribution that don't carry a license note on their
	own are licensed under the terms of the LGPL 2.1; all files that do
	carry either a LGPL or GPL note are licensed respectively under the
	LGPL or GPL as follows:
	
	(...)

where the complete texts of the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2 and
the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) version 2.1 have been omitted here
for brevity.  On any Debian GNU/Linux system, they can be found in
`/usr/share/common-licenses/GPL-2', and '/usr/share/common-licenses/LGPL-2.1',
respectively.

Earlier versions of mpg123 were distributed under a license that did not meet
Debian's free software guidelines.  Details on the relicensing process can
be found in the file ROAD_TO_LGPL that is part of mpg123's source distribution.
It is located in the 'doc' subdirectory.
