  * src/libmpg123/id3.c: Apply upstream fix for out-of-bounds error in
    id3 parser.
  * debian/mpg123.postinst: Output auto-detection is no good as long as
    output-specific wrappers are still listed as alternatives with higher
    priority. Remove alternative setting for all wrapper scripts, therefore.
    Closes: #391669
  * debian/mpg123-wrapper.in: Call mpg123 binary with exec to avoid stray
    shell process as suggested by Shane Wegner.

mpg123 (1.4.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version. Closes: #469110
    + Core engine provided as a library now. Closes: #52020
    + Different audio output systems can now be selected at runtime via a
      plugin mechanism.
    + Fixed parsing of ICY streams. Closes: #449319
  * debian/*: Major packaging overhaul.
    + Output-specific packages are turned into dummy packages as plugins in
      the main package mpg123 now provide all the required funtionality.
    + In a default installation, dependencies for the ALSA and OSS output
      plugins are pulled in via Recommends. Dependencies for the other
      output plugins are provided in Suggests. Closes: #391669
    + A package with i486-specific optimisations is no longer built. Instead,
      a dummy package will pull in the main package mpg123 providing generic
      optimisations.
    + As different output backends and CPU optimisations used to be accessible
      through separate binaries, wrapper skripts are provided using the old
      names. These wrappers are likely to be removed in the next release
      cycle, though.
