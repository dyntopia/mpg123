mpg123 (1.4.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * mpg123 now supports a plugin architecture to select different output
    mechanisms at runtime, using option -o. The OSS output plugin
    can be accessed with "mpg123 -o oss". A wrapper skript mpg123-oss is
    provided with this package mpg123 for backward compatibility, but it is
    likely to be removed in the next release cycle.
