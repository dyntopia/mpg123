Description: MPEG layer 1/2/3 audio player
 Mpg123 is a fast and portable MPEG audio player for Unix.  It supports
 MPEG 1.0/2.0 layers 1, 2 and 3 (those famous "mp3" files).
 .
 For full CD quality playback (44 kHz, 16 bit, stereo) a Pentium,
 SPARCstation10, DEC Alpha or similar CPU is required.  Mono and/or reduced
 quality playback (22 kHz or 11 kHz) is even possible on 486 CPUs.
 .
 This package contains output plugins for several audio systems, including
 OSS/Lite, the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) on Linux systems,
 the Enlightened Sound Daemon (esound), the Network Audio System (NAS),
 and others.

Description: MPEG layer 1/2/3 audio player for i486 machines - dummy package
 Mpg123 is a fast and portable MPEG audio player for Unix.  It supports
 MPEG 1.0/2.0 layers 1, 2 and 3 (those famous "mp3" files).
 .
 For full CD quality playback (44 kHz, 16 bit, stereo) a Pentium,
 SPARCstation10, DEC Alpha or similar CPU is required.  Mono and/or reduced
 quality playback (22 kHz or 11 kHz) is even possible on 486 CPUs.
 .
 This package used to contain an executable specially optimized for i486
 processors, but nowadays just depends on the generic package mpg123. It is
 an empty dummy package to facilitate upgrades and can be safely removed.
