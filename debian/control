Description: MPEG layer 1/2/3 audio player
 Mpg123 is a fast and portable MPEG audio player for Unix.  It supports
 MPEG 1.0/2.0 layers 1, 2 and 3 (those famous "mp3" files).
 . 
 For full CD quality playback (44 kHz, 16 bit, stereo) a Pentium,
 SPARCstation10, DEC Alpha or similar CPU is required.  Mono and/or reduced
 quality playback (22 kHz or 11 kHz) is even possible on 486 CPUs.
 .
 This version uses the OSS/Lite drivers for sound output.
 If you don't know which version of mpg123 you want, you probably
 want this version.
